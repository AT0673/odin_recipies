    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful light lunch. Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a little oil, and topped with two eggs.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Asparagus Stalks</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h style="font-size: large;">How to Prepare</h>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim the ends of 1 bunch of asparagus and blanch them in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, until tender-crisp. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the blanched asparagus and saut√© for 2-3 minutes, until lightly browned. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Push the asparagus to one side of the skillet. Crack 2-4 eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Optionally, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese over the eggs and asparagus.</li>
        <li>Serve the asparagus and eggs immediately, garnished with fresh herbs such as parsley or chives if desired.</li>
    </ol>
